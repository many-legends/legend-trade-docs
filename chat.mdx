Chat is built into Legend at every level -- in Arena matches, inside clans, in group chats, and between any two traders on the platform.

- **Arena chat** -- live text and voice chat with your opponent during a match. Talk trash, call your trades, or stay silent.
- **Clan chat** -- persistent group chat for your clan. Coordinate battles, share calls, and build together.
- **Direct messages** -- message any trader on the platform.
- **Group chats** -- private group chats with friends.
- **Voice rooms** -- add a voice channel to any existing text chat on the platform.

Chat is where Legend comes alive. Every match, every trade, every rank-up happens in the context of the people around you.
