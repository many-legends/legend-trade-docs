Clans are Legend's team system — compete together, climb together.

- To create a clan, you must exceed 250,000 USD lifetime volume on Legend
- Capped at 50 members — you can only be in one clan at a time
- Every clan has its own ELO, tracked separately from individual rank
- Wage clan wars against rivals and climb the seasonal clan leaderboard
- Each clan has its own chat, member list, and shared stats
- Invite friends or recruit from the leaderboard

Your clan is your identity on Legend — who you ride with.
