The feed is Legend's real-time activity stream — showing you what the traders you follow and compete against are doing across the platform.

**What appears on the feed:**

- Trades — entries, exits, and PnL from traders you follow
- Arena results — match outcomes
- Trending — [coming soon]

The feed is personalized. You see activity from people you follow, your clanmates, and trending moments across the platform. You can also view the feed scoped to any specific token chart — seeing what your network traded at key price levels.
