**Desktop Interface**

Legend's web app is the full-featured trading terminal — built for competitive traders who want the complete Arena experience with advanced charting, live spectating, and real-time PvP battles.

The web app is built on top of **Hyperliquid** via builder codes, giving traders access to deep liquidity and low-latency execution natively.

The web app supports everything from solo trading to head-to-head matchups, clan battles, match spectating, and copy-trading - all in one.
