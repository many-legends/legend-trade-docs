## Arena

Arena is the worlds first competitive trading mode - there is no equivalent. Arena is ranked mode for markets, where traders battle head-to-head in real-time PvP matches. Your performance is tracked, ranked, and visible to everyone.

Trading has always been the world's biggest videogame played. The Arena enhances this - adding wagers, spectators, and stakes beyond just PnL. The result is a new category of financial product that sits at the intersection of trading and esports.

Matches are played over fixed timeframes. Competitors agree beforehand on stake size and match variables, then match begins. The trader with the higher PnL at the end of the match wins - turning trading into a binary outcome based on outperforming your opponent, not just the market.

Every match impacts your ELO rating and rank. The Arena supports 1v1 matches and clan-based battles, with live chat between opponents during the match.
