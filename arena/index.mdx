Arena is the world's first competitive trading mode -- ranked mode for markets. Traders battle head-to-head in real-time PvP matches. Your performance is tracked, ranked, and visible to everyone.

Trading has always been the world's biggest video game. The Arena enhances it -- adding wagers, spectators, and stakes beyond just PnL. The result is a new category of financial product at the intersection of trading and esports.

Matches are played over fixed timeframes. Competitors agree on stake size and match parameters beforehand, then the match begins. The trader with the higher PnL at the end wins -- turning trading into a binary outcome based on outperforming your opponent, not just the market.

Every match impacts your ELO rating and rank. The Arena supports 1v1 matches and clan-based battles, with live chat between opponents during the match.
