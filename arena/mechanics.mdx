Arena matches use on-chain contracts for registration, payment, settlement, and periodic balance updates.

**Entering a match**

You commit your entry fee and tradable Arena Balance prior to match start. Once all parties have accepted, the match starts — and trading becomes enabled.

**During a match**

You trade perps on Legend, your tradable Arena Balance is your starting capital. Every position you open and close updates your PnL in real-time — and your opponent can see it. The goal is simple: end the match with a higher PnL than the person across from you. Account balances sync on-chain throughout.

**Settlement**

When time runs out, the match is over. Final PnL is captured, the winner is determined, and the prize is deposited into the contract. You withdraw your winnings directly — no waiting, no middleman.
