The Arena supports multiple queue types depending on how you want to compete.

**Public Match**

- Standard matchmaking based on your ELO rating
- You're matched with opponents of similar skill
- All ranked matches affect your ELO and rank progression
- Available 24/7

**Direct Challenge**

- Challenge a specific player(s) by sending them a duel link
- Both players agree on wager size and match duration before the match starts
- Shareable links - post your challenge on X or send it in a group chat
- Direct challenges can be ranked or unranked

**Clan Battles**

- Team-based matches between clans
- Clan ELO is tracked separately from individual ELO
- Results contribute to clan leaderboards and seasonal standings

**Match Timing**

- Matches run over fixed timeframes — both players trade within the same window
- Match durations vary by queue type (short, standard, extended)
- A countdown is visible to both players and spectators throughout the match

**Spectating**

- All Arena matches can be spectated in real-time
- Spectators can watch both players' PnL, positions, and trades as they happen
- Copy-trading and match betting are available from the spectator view
