When you enter an Arena match, both players commit a wager upfront. The winner takes the pot.

- Wager sizes are fixed per match - both players put up the same amount
- Wagers are denominated in USDC
- Wagers are locked at the start of the match and settled automatically at the end
- There is no partial payout - the trader with the higher PnL at match end takes the full wager

The wagers are resolved onchain via smartcontracts.
