title: "What is Legend?"
description: "The esports layer for trading"

**Legend** is the competitive social trading platform -- the esports layer for trading and the home of financial athletes.

We've built the **Arena**, where traders battle head-to-head in PvP matches with ELO rankings, clans, live spectating, and copy-trading. Discover friends, trade against others, and rank up.

_Lock in and win on Legend._
