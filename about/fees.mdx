Legend follows the Hyperliquid trading fee model.

Trading fees are based on your rolling 14-day volume, assessed at the end of each day in UTC. Sub-account volume counts toward the master account and all sub-accounts share the same fee tier. Referral rewards apply for a user's first \$1B in volume and referral discounts apply for a user's first \$25M in volume.

Maker rebates are paid out continuously on each trade directly to the trading wallet.

There are separate fee schedules for perps vs spot. Both count toward your fee tier, with spot volume counting double:

**14d weighted volume** = (14d perps volume) + 2 x (14d spot volume)

## Builder Code Fee

A builder code fee is applied on top of trading fees:
