## Trading: The World's Biggest Video Game

Our core belief is that trading is the world's biggest video game. Millions of people log in to Hyperliquid, Robinhood, Coinbase, and other terminals every single day.

We're also at an influx where any type of asset is becoming tradable. Ten years ago, the only instrument of leverage that people like us had access to was an option. Now, we have perps on almost anything -- mindshare, memecoins, prediction markets, and much more coming online.

Consider this with the second-order effects of AI, where people are looking to find alternative sources of income rather than the traditional path. The truth is that this is why most people are in crypto.

**It creates a barbell in our generation and the next one.**

## The Hypergambling Barbell

| Traditional Jobs | Middle                         | New Economy      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Plumbers         | Displaced white-collar workers | Trading          |
| Electricians     |                                | Content Creation |
| Manual Labor     |                                | Whop, pump.fun   |

Recent data supports this barbell effect: [Gen Z men with college degrees now have the same unemployment rate as non-graduates](https://fortune.com/2025/07/22/gen-z-college-graduate-unemployment-level-same-as-nongrads-no-degree-job-premium/).

On the left, you can see that you either have a choice to become a plumber or electrician or a job that is not easily replaceable by AI. In the middle you have a large segment of people who cannot find any job. Previously, it would be white-collar jobs, but those are being automated even faster than blue-collar. On the right, you have people looking for alternative sources of income. This can be selling courses, trading, or becoming an influencer.

This barbell is the underpinning Megatrend of why the fastest growing companies in the world are: **Axiom**, **Hyperliquid**, and **pump.fun**.

## Legend's Vision

Legend takes this Megatrend to the maxim:

**We are creating the ultimate platform for any trader to log on to Legend to grind, discover and trade with others, and win everyday.**

Legend is  not your next memecoin aggregation trading terminal or other Telegram bot.

We are creating a very, very opinionated surface area on where we think this Megatrend is going and building specifically for that.

**We are the intersection of gaming, live streaming, entertainment, financialization, and trading, all in one.**

We are also building **[stealth]** and **[stealth]** as second-order effects of what we believe this Megatrend allows.
