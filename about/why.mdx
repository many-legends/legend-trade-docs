## Trading: The World's Biggest Video Game

Our core belief is that trading is the world's biggest video game. Millions of people log in to Hyperliquid, Robinhood, Coinbase, and other terminals every single day.

We're at an inflection point where any type of asset is becoming tradable. Ten years ago, the only instrument of leverage most people had access to was an option. Now, we have perps on almost anything -- mindshare, memecoins, prediction markets, and much more coming online.

Combine this with AI-driven displacement of traditional jobs, and you get a generation actively seeking alternative income streams. This is the underlying force pulling people into crypto.

**It creates a barbell in our generation and the next one.**

## The Hypergambling Barbell

| Traditional Jobs | Middle                         | New Economy      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Plumbers         | Displaced white-collar workers | Trading          |
| Electricians     |                                | Content Creation |
| Manual Labor     |                                | Whop, pump.fun   |

Recent data supports this barbell effect: [Gen Z men with college degrees now have the same unemployment rate as non-graduates](https://fortune.com/2025/07/22/gen-z-college-graduate-unemployment-level-same-as-nongrads-no-degree-job-premium/).

On the left, you have trades that are hard to automate -- plumbers, electricians, manual labor. In the middle, a growing segment of displaced workers. White-collar jobs are being automated even faster than blue-collar. On the right, people building alternative income streams -- trading, creating content, selling courses.

This dynamic has fueled explosive growth in platforms like **Axiom**, **Hyperliquid**, and **pump.fun**.

## Legend's Vision

Legend takes this megatrend to its logical extreme:

**The ultimate platform for traders to grind, discover and compete with others, and win every day.**

Legend is not another memecoin aggregation terminal. We are building a deeply opinionated product at the intersection of where we think this megatrend is heading.

**Esports, live streaming, entertainment, financialization, and trading -- all in one.**
